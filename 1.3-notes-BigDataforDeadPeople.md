Take 10 notes from the keynote. Begin each note with a useful tag. Use at least 5 tags. Try to include some bibliography in each note.

##Notes:

1) What is "digital simulcra"? - Either an image or representation of something, or an unsatisfying facsimile.  Neither seems especially positive.

2) It's important to still ask relevant and thoughtful questions - not just questions of a computational nature.

3) Distant reading - the opposite of close reading?  Maybe not.  When I think of close reading, I think of exegesis - reading out of a text, instead of reading into it.  This means that we must take into account the context in which the text was written - who wrote it? when? why was it written? What do the words mean? What can we learn by studying the grammar, language, syntax, etc.? But we must be careful not to read into it.  We should be objective, and not let our reading be influenced by our own experiences in other contexts.  This is a reading approach often used by linguists.  And, incidentally, the way that I read both the Iliad and the Odyssey. Learned a lot of Greek words too - including exegesis! Or close reading is just reading carefully and with attention to detail. The distant reading world opened up by the tools used in the DH world are the complete opposite.

4) I heart Mad Men!  But why does he compare early Mad Men scripts to books published in the early 50s? The first seasons of the show are set in the early 60s.  Typo?  I'm also a little disappointed that the writer wasn't able to pick up on the gradual shift in the writing of the show.  The early seasons are VERY obviously creating a cast of characters that are the stereotypes of the time. The writers are deliberately trying to get their audience into a frame of mind.  They need to audience to completely immerse themselves in this other time and place.  And to do that, they aren't subtle in their character developments.  Smoking is sexy - we don't care about potential health hazards. Women in business?! Don't be ridiculous.  Women belong in the home. Etc.  But it's interesting that the quantitative analysis shows the shift from obvious showboating to deeper introspection.

5) The Ngram viewer - I feel like we're going to have to look deeper into this tool... If I have to guess without Googling, I'm going to say it shows us term frequency in a body of text.

6) If we don't ask thoughtful questions, if we only ask "banal" questions, then we will not be surprised by the results.  The authors examples of words linked to industrial activity or war during certain periods are perfect examples.  History has already recorded and examined those events. Now we're just testing a theory or hypothesis.  We know absolutely when there was a war. So if we analyze the frequency of the term "war" during that specific time period, we should not be surprised to find a high frequency.  It would be more surprising to find a high frequency of romantic words.  Then again... maybe not. Perhaps men away at war are inspired to write eloquent and moving love letters to their lovers back home? Maybe ladies are inspired to write romantic novels while their fellas are out fighting the good fight?  Anyway, having a high frequency of romantic terms during war time would certainly inspire me to ask more interesting questions than a high frequency of military terms.  The results of that lame analysis would look something like "Yup, there was a war".

7) He asks himself how we might better unite text and non-text digital material for a more interesting and perhaps illuminating historical perspective. I LOVE this. Here's where sonification, 3D objects, digital images, maps, GIS,video games, all kinds of fun things can come into play. I particularly like the bit about marking up the text documents as "speech acts", which help to give voice to a real person. This is also an example of close reading of digital material.  It's not all big data, all the time.  The mix helps to paint a more distinct picture of both the individual in question, and the historical, political, geographic, economic contexts in which this individual lived.

8) What is TF-IDF methodology? TF is Term Frequency. IDF... Inverse Document Frequency.  I find it challenging that many DH practitioners use acronyms and assume their readership is as DH literate as they are.  This makes learning the skills a little more challenging.  I find myself regularly Googling seemingly basic terms.

9) Ha! "Textual Humanities" - the vanilla sex of the digital humanities.  Well, we've all got to start somewhere. And I quite like vanilla - real vanilla though.  None of this artificial crap.

10) The author mentions that we do not yet have an effective way of incorporating 3D "text" into how we read the past.  Is this true? Don't we reconstruct dinosaurs using 3D models to learn about how they moved, how fast they could run?

11) (BONUS NOTES) The conundrums of positivism - the author notes that it's easy to slip into the routine of hailing each new tool or development as revolutionary.  Initially, the author mentions that he still took an approach to history and historical inquiry that was remarkably un-digital. But then Google Earth and Google maps changed his perspective. He was also affected by the way that archaeologists understood and interpreted the past.

I quite like this phrasing, "practitioners seek to discover patterns in the entrails of human leavings hoping to find the inherent meanings encoded there".

I've had several conversations about some points being raised here - namely the separation of science and the humanities. These two schools were one and the same in the ancient universities. You could not understand one without the other. And then somewhere along the line we all became specialists. And science was in one camp, and the arts and humanities were in another.  I bet this had Da Vinci rolling in his grave. And yet now, there is a reunion of sorts taking place among the digital humanists (is that an expression?). Try not to roll your eyes at us, scientists, we've got a lot of catching up to do.

I like this too, **"history is not the past, it is a genre constructed by us from practises first delineated during the enlightenment"**. This is a great point to keep in mind moving forward. It's historiography at its core.  It's the historian's craft.

### Some notes on tagging 

I could not figure out how to tag in markdown. I think I've misunderstood the assignment.  I've made all of my notes in one document.  I think each "note" is supposed to be its own thing?  Then then each document or file would be tagged with a unique tag.  I *think* I can create a YAML block (tag) by putting three dashes (-) at the beginning of the body of the text, and then closing the body with a similar set of three dashes.
