#Mod 2 Exercise 2

##Outwit hub

Search "pie" on Suda Online

[http://www.stoa.org/sol/](http://www.stoa.org/sol/ "Suda Online")

The trick here is to browse a website *inside* the Outwit Hub software - not on a regular browser like Chrome.

I'm supposed to be looking for two things; translation and adler.

I was able to view the code in Outwit Hub, but the "scrapers" tool on the left seems to be constantly 'thinking' - that is there's a little circle of dots going round and round and round, as though a web browser is still loading.

It's been several minutes, it's still thinking.  I lose patience, and will close the application and try again.  Argh.

Second attempt seemed to work much better, but I couldn't explain why.

I did, however, eventually figure out that I have to double click on the fields and fill them out as described in the exercise book.  Hard!

I exported the results to an Excel spreadsheet.

Final question of the exercise was "what other data does outwit include with your export?"  Answer: I have no idea...

When I open the Excel sheet, I see columns for Collection Date, Source URL, and then the Translation.  There are also empty columns for "R" and "P" - no idea what that's for yet.
