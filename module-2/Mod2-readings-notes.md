*Topic Modelling Martha Ballard's Diary*. Cameron Blevins. April 1, 2010.

Computers can easily give us the number of instances a term appears in a text (i.e. "God"), but has a harder time knowing that "the Author of all my Mercies" also refers to God.

Topic modelling - finds words that frequently appear together within a text, groups them in clusters.

TOOL - [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/index.php "MALLET")

It's important to note that the tool doesn't have to understand the meaning of the words, it simply shows how the words are *used*.

The author used predictable topics, such as his "Cold Weather" topic to measure it against months of the year.  The expected results were to find more instances of "Cold Weather" terms in the winter months.  This is exactly what the program showed, and so the author builds more faith in the power of the program.

It was interesting to see the way that "Housework" increased over time in the diaries. The author expected to see a decrease, but ultimately saw references to Housework increase. That led the author to ask interesting new questions. The patterns would never have been readily apparent to the average human reader.

If I understand this correctly, the computer lumps together seemingly related terms, and then the author attributes a tag to them, such as the aforementioned "Cold Weather".  Then, once a tag or title has been assigned, the author tracks that tag throughout the body of the text.

*The Joys of Abundance: The Era of Big Data*

Big data = a body of work larger than could feasibly be read and understood by a single researcher.

For Historians, it's more data than one could read in a reasonable amount of time.  Or, info that requires 'computational intervention' to make sense of it.

Computational analysis ceases to be a "nice to have" and becomes a basic requirement. (Not all historians will be digital historians, but they will become more prevalent.)

*The Third Wave of Computational History* in "The Historian's Macroscope.


First wave - humanities computing

Second wave - textual analysis

Third wave - .... [not sure what it is yet.  We are on the cusp, apparently]

Factors: decreased cost of storage, cloud computing, rise of open-source tools.

According to James Gleick, 
*"It did not occur to Sophoclesâ€™ audiences that it would be sad for his plays to be lost; they enjoyed the show. Now expectations have inverted.  Everything may be recorded and preserved, at least potentially."*

Digital Dark Age - the creation of data does not guarantee that it will be kept. There are fears that current digital information will be lost or inaccessible in the future.

Some preventative solutions: backup your data, and data migration.  Software, however, is more difficult.

Yahoo bought Geocities - and subsequently shut down one of the largest sets of user-generated content on the web. Whoops.

Inaccessible user-generated content - Facebook.  That content may be lost to history (TBD). Public facing content such as YouTube videos and blogs may be archived.

The Inernet Archive (est. 1996) is currently the world's biggest archive.

The Programming Historian 2 - open-source textbook.

TOOLS:

-**Python** - open source programming language.  Good for textual analysis and manipulation. Basic Visualizations.

**-Komodo Edit** - open source editing environment. Write code, see errors.

**-Wget** - download entire repositories, directories, websites.

*Academic Journals: The Most Profitable Obsolete Technology in History*.  Huffington Post, Feb 21, 2015.

Sidenote - I think I read this article when it first came out because colleagues were circulating it.

Academic journals are thriving, while other industries are suffering from wider access to content (music, movies, etc.).

Universities spend a large portion of their budgets each year on academic subscription fees.  3-3.5 million dollars.

The majority of academic journals are produced, reviewed, and edited on a volunteer basis by academics.

Subscription to bulk databases help make journals more accessible, but these databases rarely include the most up-to-date publications.

"A better approach to academic publishing is to cut out the whole notion of publishing. We don't really need journals as traditionally conceived. The primary role of traditional journals is to provide peer review and for that you don't need a physical journal--you just need an editorial board and an editorial process" - Gershman.

Alternative - post to a server, editorial board does similar review. Gives stamp of approval.

This requires a cultural revolution among academics.  Totally changes the way they do business.

To publishers, "open access" means paying an extra fee to have one's research published as open.  This is counter to the fundamental definition of the term!

Some granting institutions have insisted that projects they fund publish their findings as open access.

*Seams and Edges: Dreams of Aggregation, Access & Discovery in a Broken World*.  Tim Sherratt, Feb 3, 2015.

Success measured in the seconds we save through new technologies.

Seam-free services intend to maximize ease-of-use. (Library catalogues that search across institutions).

We are in a culture of search - technologies of discovery have become part of everyday life.

Google has changed the way that we expect to interact with searches. It's natural that users of other discovery services will approach them with a similar set of expectations.

Important question: if we can't find something on Google, does it exist?

It's important to remember that online services are constructed by humans.  They are not magic.

Mark Weiser argued that seamlessness is bad - it makes everything seem the same. He champions systems with "beautiful seams" that empower users to manipulate their contexts and connections.

Seams - a commitment to exposing the interpretive distance between our collection data and its online representation.
